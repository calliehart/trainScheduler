# trainScheduler - Musée d'Orsay/Gare d'Orsay Themed

## Description

This application shows a train timetable based off of entered data that is entered in the form at the bottom of the page and stored within Firebase.

The user just needs to know:
* name of the train
* destination city
* time of the first train
* frequency of train arrival

This data is then pushed to a database. To generate the table, all stored data is retrieved and the next train arrival time as well as the minutes until the next train are calculated in the javascript.
